# Modeling *Mus musculus* mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I
Mitochrondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (mt-Co1) enables cytochrome c oxidase terminal electron accepting activity in the mitochondiral respiratory chain complex IV (RC-IV). Correct native protein structure and folding is essential for functional electron transport and overall mitochondiral efficency. Errors in mt-Co1 can trap electrons in respiratory complex-III, resulting in increased production of reactive oxygen species.
